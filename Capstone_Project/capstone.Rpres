A brief description
========================================================
incremental: true
type: section

- We obtained a collection of text from news sources and this will form the corpus from which our prediction will be based
- The words were grouped into a sequence of words of varying lengths based on their sequence.
- A longer sequence of words provided better context for predicting the next word
- Some words or group of words occur more frequent than others
