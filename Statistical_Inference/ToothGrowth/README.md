- The second project for this course gives the learner the opportunity to perform a basic exploratory and inferential analysis of the ToothGrowth data that comes with a standard R installation.The dataset ToothGrowth, contains a subset of the results from experiments conducted in the 1940's by EW Crampton of the Department of Nutrition, Macdonald College, McGill University, P.O., Prov. Quebec, Canada. The experiment assessed the effects of varying doses of Vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.
