### My course project in the [Statistical Inference]("https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference")

#### Course Description

This repository contains my course project submitted through GitHub for the course [Statistical Inference]("https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference") in Coursera. This is the sixth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. The objective of the course is to teach the learner how to gather, clean, and manage data from a variety of sources using R.

### Course project requirement

In this course students will learn the fundamentals of statistical inference. Students will receive a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. Students will be able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and will be able to use the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.

There are two course project required for this course:

- The first project for this course requires the learner to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of averages of iid variables becomes that of a standard normal as the sample size increases, regardless of the underlying distribution.

- The second project for this course gives the learner the opportunity to perform a basic exploratory and inferential analysis of the ToothGrowth data that comes with a standard R installation.The dataset ToothGrowth, contains a subset of the results from experiments conducted in the 1940's by EW Crampton of the Department of Nutrition, Macdonald College, McGill University, P.O., Prov. Quebec, Canada. The experiment assessed the effects of varying doses of Vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.
