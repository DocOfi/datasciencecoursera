This repository contains my course project submitted through GitHub for the course [Developing Data Products]("https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod") in Coursera. This is the ninth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. 

A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audienc

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, the student is required to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, the student will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

The README markdown document is displayed by default by GitHub whenever you visit a GitHub repository. The document you are reading now is the README.md file. It Tcontains information about the content of this repo.

The Miscerr.Rpres is the RStudio presenter file that created the pitch presenetation. To view the pitch presentation click on [Comparing Algorithms - Guide to the App](http://rpubs.com/DocOfi/170100)

The Miscerr-figure is the folder that contains the images included in the pitch presentation.

The ose.csv file is the data file in .csv format which contained data for the pitch presentation 

The ui.R and server.R are the files that created the shiny presentationhtml version of the README.md document. To view the shiny app, click on [Comparing Algorithms](https://docofi.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp10/)

The .png files are images that are displayed in the README.md document.
