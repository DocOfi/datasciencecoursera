### Plotting EPA data using Metricsgraphics

### Course Description

This folder contains my exploration of the data found in the [Course materials for the Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) repository, particularly, from the Exploratory Data Analysis course. Using the package MetricGraphics, I created a data visualization of the datasets provided in this course.

The files used to create the data visualization are found in this folder. However, the markdown file cannot be viewed showing the plots in GitHub. You can click on this link to view the presentation http://www.rpubs.com/DocOfi/352947
