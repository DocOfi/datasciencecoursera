### Course project 1 requirement

For the first project, the student will need to write a report that answers several questions about the data written in a single R markdown document that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file.

### Sample plot

![Effects of Imputation on the mean and median](plot1.png)

### Course project 2 requirement

The basic goal of the second assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. The analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries written in a Rmarkdown document and processed as an html document. The final report will then be published in RPubs.

### Sample plot
