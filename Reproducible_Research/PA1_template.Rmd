#My Course Project for the course Reproducible Research in Coursera 
This assignment is submitted for the fulfillment of the requirements in Coursera's Reproducibe Research Peer Assessment 1. 

## Course Description
This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary Taken from the website of [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata).

## Introduction
This particular assignment, the first in this course, familiarizes the student with the use of R Markdown and the package Knitr for reporting data analysis.  It introduces the concept of imputation and how analysis is largely affected by presence and management of NAs or missing data.  It also hones the students skill in subsetting, working with dates, creating graphs and aggregating data using R programming.

##Data
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or [Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.


## Loading the data

```{r, loading_data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
fileurl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileurl, destfile = "./activity.zip")
dateDownloaded <- date()
print(dateDownloaded)
unzip('activity.zip')
```

## Reading the data in R

```{r read_data}
act <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(act)
summary(act)
head(act) 
```

Examination of the summary of the data showed that observations were recorded on a 24 hour period for 61 days with 5 minute intervals.

## Preprocessing the data

We transformed the data from the variable column date and added column variables to represent the months (months), days of the week, and days of the year (yday) when the data was recorded.  Observation were recorded from the 274^th^ to the 334^th^ day of the year 2012 or from October 1, 2012 to November 30, 2012.  

```{r, add_column}
act$date <- as.Date(act$date)
act$months <- month.name[as.POSIXlt(act$date)$mon + 1]
act$weekday <- as.POSIXlt(act$date)$wday + 1
act$weekday <- factor(act$weekday, labels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
act$yday <- as.POSIXlt(act$date)$yday
head(act)
```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

To answer the question, we first took the sum of the number of steps taken each day for the 61 days of the observation period.  

```{r, grpby_yday}
library(dplyr)
sum_byyday <- act %>% group_by(yday) %>% summarize(sum_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
colnames(sum_byyday) <- c("nth_day", "sum_steps")
head(sum_byyday)
```

To obtain the mean, we summed the total number of steps taken each day for each of the days of the observation period (`r sum(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE)`) and divided it by the total number of days of the the observation period (`r length(sum_byyday$sum_steps)`).
**NOTE** The days with 0 values in the sum_byyday data frame do not indicate 0 steps taken during these days but rather there was no observation recorded for these days or data was missing. We shall see later that several days in our data contain missing values or observations for the whole day and we shall also see how the value of 0 was assigned to these days.  We include these days in the analysis for now.

```{r, mean_step}
mean_steps_per_day <- mean(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(mean_steps_per_day)
```

We obtained the median using the equation $Median = (n +1/2)^{th} term$

```{r, median_step}
median_steps_per_day <- median(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(median_steps_per_day)
```

We present the results by creating a histogram to show the frequency distribution of the total number of steps per day. We added two vertical lines to show the median and the mean.

```{r, hist, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
hist(sum_byyday$sum_steps, col = "green", breaks = 8, xlab = "Total number of steps/day", main = "Frequency \nof total number of steps/day", col.main = "navy", col.lab = "navy", cex = 1.5)
rug(sum_byyday$sum_steps)
abline(v = mean(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)
abline(v = median(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "magenta", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
text(c(15,15), pos = 4, "Mean=9,354.23", cex = 1, col = "blue")
text(c(14,14), pos = 4, "Median=10,395", cex = 1, col = "magenta")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

To answer the question, we first grouped the number of steps taken, according to the five minute intervals of observation each day. We then made a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).  To improve readability, we changed the column variable names to be more descriptive.

```{r, grpby_int}
by_interval <-group_by(act, interval)
meanstep_byinterval <- summarise(by_interval, mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
colnames(meanstep_byinterval) <- c("interval", "mean_steps")
print(meanstep_byinterval)
```

Taking the mean of the total number of steps taken for each 5-minute interval throughout the day, we then determined what was the highest mean number of steps taken throughout the day. 

```{r, maxsteps}
maxsteps_byinterval <- max(meanstep_byinterval$mean_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(maxsteps_byinterval)
```
We then determined at which time interval did the highest mean number of steps occurred.

```{r, int_moststeps}
interval_with_moststeps <- meanstep_byinterval[meanstep_byinterval$mean_steps == maxsteps_byinterval, ]
print(interval_with_moststeps)                                
```
 
The highest mean number of steps occurred occurred at 8:35 am.
 
```{r, time_act} 
plot(meanstep_byinterval$interval/100, meanstep_byinterval$mean_steps, type = "l", xlab = "Time Interval (Hours)", ylab = "Mean number of steps") 
abline(h = max(meanstep_byinterval$mean_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "magenta", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
title(main = "Mean number of steps\nfor each Time Interval", col.main = "navy")
text(c(180), pos = 4, offset = 11.1, "Max Steps=206.1698", cex = 1, col = "magenta")
text(c(150), pos = 4, offset = 11.1, "Time Interval=8:35 am", cex = 1, col = "blue") 
```

## Imputing missing values

To Calculate and report the total number and percent of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs), we use the following commands in R.

### Proportion of missing values in the data

```{r, sumNA}
sum(is.na(act))
mean(is.na(act))
sum(is.na(act$date))
sum(is.na(act$interval))
sum(is.na(act$steps))
mean(is.na(act$steps))
mean(!is.na(act$steps))
```

We can see that the number of missing values or NAs  compared to the total number of values in the the whole data (`r round(mean(is.na(act))* 100, 2)`%) is few.  However, if we look at the percentage of NAs in the steps variable column, we find that the number of NAs compared to the total number of observations in this column is high (`r round(mean(is.na(act$steps))* 100, 2)`%). The high percentage of missing data in this variable column (In fact all missing values are located in this Varible column) can significantly affect the analysis of the data involving this variable.  We can further investigate the distribution of these missing values.

```{r, time}
missing_values <- is.na(act$steps)
NA_days <- act[missing_values, ]
NA_dates <- unique(NA_days$date)
days_withNAs <- format(as.POSIXct(NA_dates), "%+")
print(days_withNAs)
```

We can see that the missing values are isolated in certain dates.  In the following, we shall see that the NAs are not only located in certain days, but rather all throughout those particular days. 

```{r, tap}
wholeday_NAs <- with(act, tapply(steps, date, summary)) 
print(wholeday_NAs[c(1, 8, 32, 35, 40, 41, 45, 61)])

```

### Distribution of missing values in the data

In the following we can see that there are more missing values in November than in October.  More Missing values are found in Mondays and Fridays (represented by 2 and 6) compared to the rest of the week and there are no missing values on Tuesdays. The NAs are uniformly distributed in the observation intervals throughout the day.

```{r, Yiming}
NAdf <- act[is.na(act$steps), ]
table(NAdf$months)
table(NAdf$weekday)
table(NAdf$interval)
```

The next part of the assignment directs us to create a systematic strategy to replace the missing values, a process called imputation. There are several ways to implement imputation.

First, we make a copy of our original data frame to protect the data from being changed

```{r, new_data}
imp_act <- act
head(imp_act)
```

There are several strategies to replace missing values using single or multiple mean values.  The simplest solution to  replace the missing values is to use the impute function from the package Hmisc.  The impute function replaces all the missing values or NAs with a single value, the mean of all the values found in the variable column steps (`r round(mean(act$steps, na.rm = TRUE))`). 

```{r, hmis}
library(Hmisc)
imp_act$steps <- round(impute(imp_act$steps, mean))
sumNAS_imp_act <- sum(is.na(imp_act))
head(imp_act)
print(sumNAS_imp_act)
```

After imputation, we can see now that there are `r sum(is.na(imp_act))` missing values in our new data frame with imputed values.

```{r, sum_imp}
impactby_yday <-group_by(imp_act, yday)
impactsum_byyday <- summarise(impactby_yday, sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
colnames(impactsum_byyday) <- c("nth_day", "sum_steps")
head(impactsum_byyday)
```

We now make a histogram to show the the frequency distribution of the number of steps taken in the new data set with imputed values. But first, we will compute the mean and median for comparison with the previous data frame without imputed values. 

```{r, mean_imp}
mean_imp_stepsbyday <- mean(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(mean_imp_stepsbyday)
median_imp_stepsbyday <- median(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(median_imp_stepsbyday)
```

We now make the histogram

```{r, histimp, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
hist(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, col = "green", breaks = 8, xlab = "Total number of steps/day", main = "Frequency \nof total number of steps/day", sub = "Days with missing values replaced by single mean", col.main = "navy", col.lab = "navy", col.sub = "red", cex = 1,5)
rug(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps)
abline(v = mean(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)
abline(v = median(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "magenta", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
text(c(15,15), pos = 4, "Mean=10,751.74", cex = 1, col = "blue")
text(c(14,14), pos = 4, "Median=10,656", cex = 1, col = "magenta")
```

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps? Let's compare it with the original data.

Comparing the histograms of the data with NAs and the one with imputed values we can see that the mean and median of the data set with imputed values are closer together, indicating that the distribution of values in the steps variable have narrowed or grown closer together.  Results appear to have homogenized. Although, range, the maximum and the minimum value, are not affected. Values approximating the mean increased in frequency as expected.

A study  entitled ["Impact of missing data imputation methods on gene expression clustering and classification"](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/16/64) performed a broad analysis of the impact of five well-known missing value imputation methods on three clustering and four classification methods in the context of 12 cancer gene expression datasets. 

Their results suggest that the imputation methods evaluated have a minor impact on the classification and downstream clustering analyses and concluded that simple methods such as replacing the missing values by mean or the median values performed as well as more complex strategies.

However, our esteemed professor, Dr. Roger D Peng in his lecture video [Evidence-based Data Analysis Part 3](https://class.coursera.org/repdata-033/lecture/45) explicitly stated that replacing missing values should not be performed.  In the particular scenario of a pollution study, data is hard to collect.  Data is collected once every six days and values are systematically missing for five days. "Imputing values for the days where there are no observation simply add more noise to the data".

### An alternative way to impute using multiple mean values.

Taking into account the distribution of NAS. From the above, we know that the NAs are equally distributed over the different time intervals.

Since the missing values are equally distributed in the time intervals, taking the mean number of steps grouped by intervals will provide a closer approximation of the value instead of using a single value to replace all missing values.

```{r, goupbyt}
by_interval <-group_by(act, interval)
meanstep_byinterval <- summarise(by_interval, mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
colnames(meanstep_byinterval) <- c("interval", "mean_steps")
mean_act <- merge(act,meanstep_byinterval)
```

Let's take a look at a few rows of the new column variable mean_steps that contain the values that will replace the NAs in the steps column variable.

```{r, meansteps}
mean_act <- arrange(mean_act, date)
head(mean_act, 6)
```

Let's replace the NAs in the steps column variable

```{r, replaced}
mean_act$steps[is.na(mean_act$steps)] <- mean_act$mean_steps[is.na(mean_act$steps)]
sum(is.na(mean_act))
head(mean_act, 10)
tail(mean_act, 10)
```

We now take the total number of steps each day, 

```{r, multiimp}
multiimpactby_yday <-group_by(mean_act, yday)
multiimpactsum_byyday <- summarise(multiimpactby_yday, sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
colnames(multiimpactsum_byyday) <- c("nth_day", "sum_steps")
head(multiimpactsum_byyday)
```
We can now see the result of our imputation with multiple mean values.  Let's make a histogram for comparison with our original data and the one with missing values replaced by a single mean value. We added two vertical lines to show the median and the mean.

```{r, histoimp, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
hist(multiimpactsum_byyday$sum_steps, col = "green", breaks = 8, xlab = "Total number of steps/day", main = "Frequency \nof total number of steps/day", sub = "Days with missing values replaced with multiple means", col.main = "navy", col.lab = "navy", col.sub = "red", cex = 1.5)
rug(multiimpactsum_byyday$sum_steps)
abline(v = mean(multiimpactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)
abline(v = median(multiimpactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "magenta", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
text(c(15,15), pos = 4, "Mean=10766.19", cex = 1, col = "blue")
text(c(14,14), pos = 4, "Median=10,766.19", cex = 1, col = "magenta")

hist(sum_byyday$sum_steps, col = "green", breaks = 8, xlab = "Total number of steps/day", main = "Frequency \nof total number of steps/day", sub = "Original data with missing values replaced by zero", col.main = "navy", col.lab = "navy", col.sub = "red", cex = 1.5)
rug(sum_byyday$sum_steps)
abline(v = mean(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)
abline(v = median(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "magenta", lwd = 2, lty = 2) 
text(c(15,15), pos = 4, "Mean=9354.23", cex = 1, col = "blue")
text(c(14,14), pos = 4, "Median=10395", cex = 1, col = "magenta")

hist(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, col = "green", breaks = 8, xlab = "Total number of steps/day", main = "Frequency \nof total number of steps/day", sub = "Days with missing values replaced by single mean", col.main = "navy", col.lab = "navy", col.sub = "red", cex = 1.5)
rug(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps)
abline(v = mean(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)
abline(v = median(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "magenta", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
text(c(15,15), pos = 4, "Mean=10751.74", cex = 1, col = "blue")
text(c(14,14), pos = 4, "Median=10,656", cex = 1, col = "magenta")
```

Imputation by a single mean value (plot on the right) or multiple mean values (plot on the left) resulted in the median approximating the mean, since the values we imputed were based on mean values. It might not be very obvious, but all three plota underwent the process of imputation.  The middle plot had its NAs replaced as a by-product of using the function summarise (dplyr package) in conjunction with the function sum and its argument na.rm = TRUE, to obtain the total number of steps per day. The missing values were assigned the value of *zero* on days where all observations were missing. 

### Comparing  histograms of the same data that underwent different strategies of imputation and the same data where missing values were removed.

There are 8 days where the total number of steps is 0.  The number of steps is not actually zero, but rather, data during these days are missing.  During the computation for the total number of steps, the missing values were conveniently represented by 0

```{r, NAsum_byyday}
sum_byydayNA <- sum_byyday[sum_byyday$sum_steps == 0, ]
print(sum_byydayNA)
sum_byydaynoNA <- sum_byyday[sum_byyday$sum_steps != 0, ]
head(sum_byydaynoNA)
```

Removing these days in the computation of the mean and median yields a similar mean and median where the missing values are replaced by single or multiple mean values.

```{r, impute_remove, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(multiimpactsum_byyday$sum_steps, col = "green", breaks = 8, xlab = "Total number of steps/day", main = "Frequency \nof total number of steps/day", sub = "Days with missing values replaced by multiple means", col.main = "navy", col.lab = "navy", col.sub = "red", cex = 2.5)

text(c(14,14), pos = 4, "Median=10,765", cex = 0.8, col = "magenta")

abline(v = mean(impactsum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)

text(c(20,20), pos = 4, "Mean=10,751.74", cex = 0.8, col = "blue")
text(c(19,19), pos = 4, "Median=10,656", cex = 0.8, col = "magenta")

hist(sum_byyday$sum_steps, col = "green", breaks = 8, xlab = "Total number of steps/day", main = "Frequency \nof total number of steps/day", sub = "Original data with missing values replaced by zero", col.main = "navy", col.lab = "navy", col.sub = "red", cex = 1.5)
rug(sum_byyday$sum_steps)
abline(v = mean(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)
abline(v = median(sum_byyday$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE), col = "magenta", lwd = 2, lty = 2) 
text(c(15,15), pos = 4, "Mean=9354.23", cex = 0.8, col = "blue")
text(c(14,14), pos = 4, "Median=10395", cex = 0.8, col = "magenta")

```

Based on our results, the median and mean yielded similar results when missing values were replaced through imputation with multiple or single mean values and when the missing values were removed. Unknowingly substituting missing values with zero leads to an error in extracting mean and median values.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

To answer the question, we make a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day. We then extract the mean of the variable steps grouped according to interval and weektype.  We will be using our data with the missing values replaced by a single mean value.

```{r, wkends}
imp_act <- mutate(imp_act, weektype = ifelse(imp_act$weekday == "Sunday" | imp_act$weekday == "Saturday", "weekend", "weekday"))
imp_byintwkt <-group_by(imp_act, interval, weektype)
sumimp_byintwkt <-summarise(imp_byintwkt, mean(steps))
colnames(sumimp_byintwkt)[3] <-c("mean_steps")
head(sumimp_byintwkt)
```

To visually compare the activity level during weekdays (Monday-Friday) and weekends (Saturday and Sunday), we make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 
```{r, timeser2}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(sumimp_byintwkt, aes(x = interval/100, y = mean_steps, color = weektype)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~weektype, ncol = 1, nrow = 2) + ggtitle("Comparing The Mean Number of Steps\nduring Weekends and Weekdays") + xlab("Time Interval (Hours)") + ylab("Mean Number of Steps") + geom_hline(aes(yintercept= max(sumimp_byintwkt$mean_steps))) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept= max(subset(sumimp_byintwkt, sumimp_byintwkt$weektype == "weekend")$mean_steps))) + geom_line(stat="hline", yintercept="mean")
print(g)
```

1. The black horizontal lines represent the difference between the mean maximum number of steps during weekdays and weekends.  

2. The blue and pink horizontal lines represent the respective means of the mean number of steps during weekends and weekdays. It is surprising to know that the mean of the weekends (`r round(mean(subset(sumimp_byintwkt, sumimp_byintwkt$weektype == "weekend")$mean_steps), 2)`) is greater than the mean during weekdays(`r round(mean(subset(sumimp_byintwkt, sumimp_byintwkt$weektype == "weekday")$mean_steps), 2)`).

2. We can see from the above that activity or the number of steps  increases abruptly and earlier during weekdays, plateaus, and then abruptly increase again, reaching peak levels between 8 and 9 am.
